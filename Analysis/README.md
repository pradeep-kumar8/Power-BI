# Ticket Analysis Dashboard
## Objective:
The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of ticket data for Workelevate, specifically for the Space Matrix Group. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand ticket trends, assess resolution performance, and identify key issues by category and sub-category. It consolidates essential metrics and visualizations to facilitate data-driven decision-making in ticket management.

## Goal:
The primary goal of this dashboard is to:
1. Monitor the volume and resolution status of tickets over time.
2. Track the progress of ticket closures to evaluate operational efficiency.
3. Identify high-volume ticket categories and specific issues to prioritize resources for resolution.
4. Provide actionable insights to improve the ticket resolution rate and reduce unresolved tickets.

## Closure Rate (Donut Chart):
### Purpose: 
The donut chart visually represents the ratio between "Doable" and "Not Doable" tickets, indicating closure status.
#### Details:
The inner circle represents the total ticket count (3,725).
##### The segments show:
1. Doable: Tickets that can be resolved (30.98%).
2. Not Doable: Tickets that cannot be resolved (69.02%).
3. This visual helps stakeholders quickly grasp the closure rate and understand the division of resolved versus unresolved tickets.

#### Columns:
1. Issue: Lists the specific sub-category of each ticket (e.g., "3Ds Max," "Access Required," "Account Unlock").
2. Yes: Indicates the count of tickets resolved under each sub-category.
3. No: Indicates the count of tickets unresolved under each sub-category.
4. Total: Shows the total tickets for each sub-category (sum of "Yes" and "No").

**Insight:** This table allows for a granular view of the types of issues encountered and highlights areas with higher unresolved ticket counts, helping teams prioritize based on specific issues.
